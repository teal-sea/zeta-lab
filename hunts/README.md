# `hunts/` — probes, not departments

A **hunt** is an exploratory attack: a scoped directory where an agent or a
person chases a specific idea hard, with permission to be wrong in public.
Hunts are where the fun is, and the tree wants them.

They are also the one place in this repository where a claim can be written
down before anything has tried to kill it. So the classification is explicit:

> **A hunt is a probe. Nothing in `hunts/` is a result.**

Per `docs/doors/README.md` and `harness/README.md`, the admission rule for a
*department* is **no department without a battery** — a body of work whose
claims nothing in this tree can falsify is not a department, it is a probe,
and probes belong where nobody will mistake one for a result. That place is
here.

A hunt can never become a department by growing, and the reason is the one
`ROADMAP.md` records for `dossier/`: a hunt's rivals are the *zeta*
department's rivals, and **a department whose battery is another department's
battery is not a department**. A hunt borrows department #1's referee. That is
the correct relationship, not a deficiency — but it does mean the referee has
to actually be invoked.

## What a hunt may and may not do

| May | May not |
|---|---|
| build its own instruments under `hunts/<name>/` | modify `zeta/`, `ontology/` or `harness/` without explicit permission |
| record raw measurements in its own `results*.json` | write a verdict into `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md` or `HANDOFF.md` as an established finding |
| use the word *measured*, *observed*, *consistent with* | use *verified*, *confirmed*, *definitively*, *proves* — and never *certified*, which `zeta/rigor.py` owns |
| propose a candidate for the funnel or the battery | promote its own claim |

A hunt that wants its claim to count takes it through the battery
(`docs/doors/refute.md`) or the funnel (`docs/doors/discover.md`). Those are
the two doors that can say "yes", and neither of them is the hunt itself.

## The standing checklist, in this repo's own idiom

Before a hunt's finding leaves `hunts/`, it must have survived the four
instrument roles — and the checks are the ones the tree already owns:

1. **Rival.** Does the claim also hold for a function that shares the
   structure and violates RH? `zeta.epstein.battery`. Note the trap below:
   if your test set *is* the rival set, you have measured your own selection
   criterion.
2. **Decoy / surrogate.** Does a matched null with no arithmetic in it
   reproduce the effect? `zeta.surrogate`, `NULLCONTROLS.md`. `ROADMAP.md`
   records the calibration that matters here: against a null of random
   non-factoring sequences, Davenport–Heilbronn sits at the **27th
   percentile** — typical, not exotic. Anything claiming a factorization
   effect must beat that null.
3. **Lesion.** Does the detector notice a violation planted on purpose, and
   can it tell that planted violation apart from the claimed signal? If it
   cannot, the detector is measuring the plant.
4. **Precision response.** Does the effect move when the approximation
   improves? `ROADMAP.md`'s standing rule, earned three times: **an artifact
   does not respond to added precision; a real quantity does.**

## Case log

### Hunt #4 — repairing the counterexample (`flow_repair/`)

**Status: probe, complete. Instrument kept; no claim promoted; the headline
is a measured constant for the rival — and a null control that explains it.**

Pointed the de Bruijn–Newman flow (`zeta/heatflow.py`'s deformation, rebuilt
generic-Φ in the probe) at the Davenport–Heilbronn function for the first
time. Derived Φ_DH = 4e^{3u/2}Σ n aₙ e^{−πn²e^{2u}/5}, then *measured* the
normalisation rather than trusting the derivation: (c, a) = (1, 1) to 4.2e-42,
route agreement with `completed_dh` to 7.2e-41, and the same evaluator
reproduces `zeta.heatflow.H_t` to 5.4e-42 before being trusted on the rival.
Raw numbers in `flow_repair/results.json`:

- **The nine known off-line quadruples (Spira 1994; Balanzario–Sánchez-Ortiz
  2007, each re-polished in-tree) land on the real axis at measured times
  t\* between 0.00275 and 0.05765.** Each is a lower bound for
  Λ_DH := inf{t : H_t^{DH} real-rooted}; the max comes from the height-240
  pair (β ≈ 0.8695), **not** the famous height-85.7 zero, which places third.
  Λ_DH ≥ 0.0577 measured — inside [0, 0.2], the interval that historically
  bracketed Λ_ζ. In flow time, the counterexample fails RH by less than ζ's
  own uncertainty span: "Λ is small" distinguishes nothing (gate #3 on the
  flow axis).
- **Null control, the headline**: the arithmetic-free N-body zero dynamics
  ż = 2Σ1/(z−z') seeded with the measured t = 0 configuration reproduces
  every PDE repair time to **±0.04%** (target was 1%). The repair clock reads
  zero geometry, not arithmetic — the flow-time distance to real-rootedness
  is a property of where the zeros sit, shared by any function with that
  layout. Position-sensitivity (docs/18) meets the counterexample gate.
- **Method worth keeping**: the pair is tracked through its collision by
  contour moments — Δ(t) = 2q₂ − q₁² is analytic through the landing, so t\*
  is a clean root even though the zeros themselves have a branch point.
  Zero-census accounting closed in all five checked windows (line + 2·pairs
  = strip count; e.g. 49 + 4 = 53 at pair 1).
- **Lesions**: a contour clipping one pair member is refused (N=1 ≠ 2); a
  contour through the zeros returns winding ~1.8e9 and is refused. Post-
  landing, the newborn real pair is invisible to the default mean-gap/20
  sign scan at 3 of 5 grid phases until gap/step ≳ 1.4 — hunt #3's blind
  spot, measured on the other side of a collision.
- **Precision response**: t\*₁ = 0.0441263445516 identical to the last digit
  across dps 44/54/70 and 96/192 contour nodes; spread exactly 0.

**Disposition:** measurement portrait of a rival's flow geometry; no ledger
entry (the surviving observation — repair times are configuration geometry —
is the null control *explaining* the quantity, which is a closure, not a
lead). Nothing here is evidence for or against RH; nine pairs bound a sup
over infinitely many from below and say nothing about Λ_DH itself. Spine
candidate recorded in `flow_repair/NOTES.md`: a Φ-parametric entry point for
`zeta/heatflow.py` (a `zeta/` change, not this hunt's).

### Hunt #3 — the closest call (`lehmer_pair/`)

**Status: probe, complete. Instrument kept; no claim promoted; the headline
is a negative result supplied by the rival.**

Pointed the ball-arithmetic arm at Lehmer's pair γ₆₇₀₉/γ₆₇₁₀ ≈ 7005.06/7005.10
(gap 0.0377, mean spacing 0.895). Measured, with raw numbers in
`lehmer_pair/results.json`:

- The near-miss bump between the pair was decided **positive at 64 bits by
  both backends** — `proven_sign` pattern −,+,− on exact rationals, midpoints
  agreeing on `Z(7005.0819) = 0.003967335016595021` to all 16 digits — and a
  dense scan found exactly 2 sign changes with zero undecided samples.
- **Lesion**: the default grid policy of `rigor.certified_sign_changes`
  (mean_spacing/20 ≈ 0.0448) is *wider than the Lehmer gap*; sweeping the
  window phase, the default grid missed the pair entirely at 1 of 5 phases.
  Honest both times (a sign-change count is a lower bound), but blind.
- **Precision response**: enclosure widths shrink ~2^−prec with the midpoint
  pinned; at 32 bits flint straddles zero while mpmath.iv decides — the
  backends disagree about *decidability* at the boundary, never about value.
- **Rival, the headline**: the predicted "failed Lehmer bump" at
  Davenport–Heilbronn's off-line zero does not exist — Z_dh's closest
  approach on [85.2, 86.2] is **−0.357**, two orders of magnitude farther
  from zero than ζ's bump clears it, while hiding 2 strip zeros. So
  "|Z| gets small" flags nothing: it fires on ζ's healthiest close pair and
  stays silent at an actual RH violation. Magnitude heuristics die here;
  sign counting vs strip counting survives.

**Disposition:** portrait, not conjecture — no ledger entry. Spine candidate
recorded in `lehmer_pair/NOTES.md`: the default-step blind spot deserves a
docstring line on the packaged scanner (a `zeta/` change, not this hunt's).

### Hunt #2 — factorization vs. position (`factorization_vs_position/`)

**Status: probe, not established. The instrument used cannot support the
claim that was recorded.**

The hunt asked whether the factorization defect `D(F)` quantitatively
controls the Weil position residue, and recorded a "verified" correlation on
Epstein forms of discriminants −15, −20, −23, −24. Three defects, each
checked in-tree:

- **The completeness gate was never called.** `zeta/detector.py`'s own
  docstring states the load-bearing caveat: the residue measures "zeros
  unaccounted for by the supplied on-line list", so *a missing on-line zero
  produces a residue indistinguishable from an off-line zero*, and **a scan
  whose completeness has not been checked reports nothing trustworthy**.
  `online_list_is_complete` appears nowhere in `hunts/`. The on-line zeros
  were found by a `step=0.05` sign-change scan, which skips close pairs.
- **The lesion confirms the confound, measured.** Give ζ — factorization
  defect `2.65e-32`, a perfect Euler product — a zero list with **one
  on-line zero removed**, and the residue jumps from `0.0038` to **`1.99`**.
  An O(1) position residue is therefore produced by an incomplete list at
  *zero* factorization defect, which is precisely the signal the hunt read as
  off-line zeros. The recorded residues (4.07–4.33) sit at about twice that
  lesion.
- **The test set is the rival set.** The discriminant −23 principal form
  `(1,1,6)` is a **registered rival in `zeta.epstein.battery`**, admitted
  precisely because it lacks a scalar Euler product while keeping the
  functional equation. Confirming that the battery's rivals lack an Euler
  product and have off-line zeros restates their admission criterion. Under
  gate #3 that distinguishes nothing.

Separately, the recorded data does not show the claimed relationship:
across `results2.json` the defect varies by 2.7× (4.25 → 11.46) while the
residue moves 6% (4.07 → 4.33), and in `results.json` a 67× change in defect
(1.58 → 105.95) moves the residue 1.36× with `argmax_c` pinned at the same
`86.0` for all nine rows — the scan-window signature `docs/17` §2 says to
distrust.

**Disposition:** instrument retained, claim withdrawn, no ledger entry. The
correction to `HANDOFF.md` is in the same commit as this note. What the hunt
did produce is real and worth keeping: a *generalized* residue detector that
accepts an arbitrary archimedean bracket, which is the reusable part.
