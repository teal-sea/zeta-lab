# Erdős problem 359

The statement below is vendored **verbatim** from `formal-conjectures/359.lean`:
`IsGoodFor` and `erdos_359.parts.i`, copied exactly, with the literal `sorry`
kept. The `sorry` is the advertised open statement, not an uncertified step in
a proof: do not restate, generalise, weaken or specialise it, and do not
"fix" it in this file.

Only the surrounding scaffolding (the header, `import Mathlib`, and the
`open Filter` needed for `atTop`) is ours; every line of the two declarations
is upstream's.
