# ROADMAP.md — what was built, why, and what is next

`README.md` says what the lab *is*. `AGENTS.md` says how to work in it. This file
records the **decisions**: why the work went the way it did, what is deliberately
not being attempted, what is known to be missing, and what the next build is.

It exists because the reasoning behind a project is the first thing lost between
sessions, and the cost of losing it is repeating settled arguments.

## What is built

| phase | what landed | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `core`, `zeros`, `explicit`, `statistics`, `heatflow` + docs 00–08 | the classical machinery, each identity measured rather than assumed |
| 2 | `weil`, `epstein` + docs 09–11 | the two ontology gates that can be made computational (positivity; the counterexample constraint) |
| 3 | `rigor`, `li`, `finitefield`, `criteria` + doc 12 | certified arithmetic; the real-rootedness lane; the universe where RH is a theorem; the remaining equivalence faces |
| 4 | `discovery/` + `scripts/13` | the conjecture funnel, schema-first, with conversion metrics |

The organising chain is in `README.md`: theta is the heat kernel → Poisson
summation → the functional equation → the mirror at `Re s = 1/2` → the explicit
formula → the same heat flow on `Ξ` gives the de Bruijn–Newman constant, where
RH ⟺ Λ = 0 and Λ ≥ 0 is a theorem.

## The strategic bet, and its honest status

Of the attacks catalogued in `docs/08-why-it-is-hard.md`, every one has a
standing no-go result against it. The **ontology route** — new objects, new
actions, new rulebooks (`docs/09`) — is the only strategy with a win on the board
(the Weil conjectures, 1974) and no impossibility theorem against it. That is why
phases 2–4 point that way.

Three independent lines converge on the same corner, which is the reason for the
emphasis on heat flow and real-rootedness (`docs/05`, `zeta/li.py`):

1. Λ ≥ 0 says the zeros sit at an exactly *marginal* configuration — the
   signature of an equilibrium of some dynamics.
2. GUE statistics say they behave like the spectrum of a chaotic system.
3. Poincaré fell to a smoothing flow with singularity control; Kadison–Singer
   fell to real-rootedness control via its equivalence web (`docs/12`).

**Honest caveat, recorded deliberately.** Calling this "the field's consensus"
overstates it. The content is standard; the confidence is not. Many number
theorists would say plainly that nobody knows what RH needs. The bet is a bet.

## What is deliberately *not* being attempted

- **Proving RH, or any part of it.** See `docs/00` §scope and `docs/08`. Nothing
  computed here is evidence. If a computation appears to settle something, the
  correct inference is a bug.
- **Representing ontology *proposals* inside the discovery funnel.** The schema
  has no representation of a mechanism (`discovery/README.md` §7, blind spot 5),
  and a proposed new ontology is nothing but a mechanism. Forcing it in would
  make the schema pretend. Ontology work stays in `docs/` and is judged against
  the four gates in `docs/09` directly.
- **Chasing computational reach for its own sake.** mpmath, Arb, PARI/GP,
  SageMath and LMFDB already exist and are better at raw computation than
  anything written here. This repo uses them as engines and independent oracles.
  What it adds is the assembled workbench and the written course.

## Completed audits

**Phase 4's cross-cutting audit is complete.** It forced plug-in exceptions and
an operating-system kill, resumed the open checkpoint, exercised duplicates,
grepped code/docs/console output for novelty leakage, recomputed the scorecard
from raw run records, mutation-tested the Mertens adjudicator by forcing a false
`survives`, and mechanically checked the domain-agnostic seam. Two accounting
defects were fixed: crash-interrupted candidates now remain in per-generator
denominators, and `refuted` no longer counts as `unsettled`.

**Schema 1.1 follow-up shipped.** Candidates can carry typed `related_to` edges:
`implies` for a directed implication and `equivalent_to` for a symmetric claim.
Edges are unhashed annotations, so adding one never changes candidate identity.
The schema validates their shape but deliberately does not require targets,
reciprocal edges or verdict propagation; those are whole-ledger concerns.

## Known gaps

Listed because an undocumented gap becomes an assumption.

1. **The documents were audited by agents, not by domain experts or against the
   literature.** The audits caught real errors, which is evidence they work, but
   correlated blind spots are exactly what that method cannot catch. No one with
   domain expertise has read a line of it. This is the largest unhedged risk in
   the repository.
2. **Expected funnel yield is approximately zero, by design.** Nearly everything
   will return already-known or refuted. The first real run: 26 candidates → 20
   known, 1 trivial, 5 inconclusive, 0 survivors. That is the machine working.
   A conjecture factory that produced discoveries on its first run would be
   broken. The value is the discipline and the record, not the hits.

## Next build: moments

Ladder rung 1 from `docs/12`'s closing section, and the most realistic target
identified so far.

**First increment shipped.** `zeta/moments.py` ingests LMFDB plain-text exports
and all six tables on Odlyzko's public index, including the offset headers at
the `10^12`, `10^21`, and `10^22` landmarks. It verifies caller-supplied
checksums, records the actual input digest, and validates declared counts,
contiguous indices, positivity and strict ordering. Absolute ordinates stay as
exact decimal base-plus-offset data: converting the `10^22` window to float64
would collapse neighbouring zeros to the same number. It computes no zeros.

**Second increment shipped.** The finite estimator consumes separately sourced
samples of `|ζ(1/2+it)|` inside an imported zero window. This separation is
mandatory: zero ordinates do not determine the values between them. It reports
the caller-supplied value error and a nested-grid sampling-error estimate in
different fields. The reference layer derives the Keating–Snaith/CFKRS leading
constant, recovers the proved coefficients `1` and `1/(2π²)` for the second and
fourth moments, and keeps the Euler-product truncation visible for the
conjectural sixth and eighth moments. The scorecard withholds those open rows
unless both proved rows pass a caller-stated calibration tolerance; a mutation
test changes the fourth-moment constant and verifies that the gate fails.

No external critical-line **value** dataset is bundled. Odlyzko and LMFDB zero
tables supply the window and provenance, not `|ζ|` samples. Acquiring such a
dataset therefore remains an operator/data task, not something the estimator
silently fabricates. The complete contract is in `docs/13-moments.md`.

**Why.** The 2nd (1918) and 4th (1926) moments of `ζ` on the critical line are
proven; the **6th and 8th are open**, with exact constants predicted by random
matrix theory (Keating–Snaith). Moments are self-convolutions — `ζ(s)² = Σ d(n)n^{-s}`,
and the `2k`-th moment corresponds to the `k`-fold divisor function — so this is
the analytic face of the same convolution algebra that produces the Euler
product. It is also the retail version of the Lindelöf Hypothesis, the domino
most likely to fall before RH.

**Critical design constraint.** Do **not** compute the zeros for this. The lab
holds ~10⁴ zeros reaching height ≈3.5×10³; the moment behaviour worth measuring
lives many orders of magnitude higher, and Odlyzko's published tables reach the
10²⁰–10²² landmarks. Build an ingestion path for external zero tables
(LMFDB, Odlyzko) and run the verified machinery against real data at real
heights. Computing our own would be both slower and worse.

**Next code build:** not yet committed. The outstanding moments task is acquiring
an external critical-line value dataset, explicitly an operator/data task rather
than an estimator change.
